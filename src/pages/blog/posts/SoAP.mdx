## Part 1: Streamlining Applications with SoAP

Dear Students,

We are thrilled to announce the first phase of automating our academic workflows, starting with the **Standardization of Academic Procedures (SoAP)** initiative. Many of you have faced confusion when submitting academic applications—whether it’s understanding the procedures, determining the right authorities, or knowing how to format formal requests.

To address this, we are introducing standardized templates for academic queries, issues, and requests to the academic office.

You can find the initial guidelines and templates here: **[SoAP Applications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IBN3V-WaqKzmrkGNlPYarRpiCMOUQl-ozTfi1f_VNlE/edit)**.

These standardized forms will make the process clearer, ensuring requests are properly directed and handled efficiently, saving you both time and effort.

### Instructions for Submitting Applications

1. **Use the Template**  
   Download and edit the provided template according to your specific use case (e.g., leave application, scholarship request).

2. **Take Approvals (if required)**  
   If the form requires departmental approval, ensure you get the necessary signatures from your respective faculty or departmental officials.

3. **Submit in the Academic Office**  
   Once the form is complete and approved, submit it to the academic office during working hours.

4. **Track Application Status**  
   Follow up on the status of your application with the academic office, if necessary, to ensure timely processing.

## Part 2: Academic Handbook – Coming Soon!

We understand academic guidelines can sometimes be overwhelming and unclear. To further support your academic journey, we are preparing a comprehensive **Academic Handbook**, which will provide detailed, up-to-date guidelines for all academic procedures.

This handbook will cover everything you need to know, from course registration and exam policies to scholarship applications and leave procedures. It will be your one-stop reference to help you make informed decisions throughout your time at IIT Patna.

Stay tuned for the full release of the **Academic Handbook** soon!
